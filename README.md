Project Overview:

The project conducts an in-depth review of Apple Inc.'s progress toward achieving carbon neutrality by the year 2030.

This project focuses on using data provided by Apple in their Environmental Progress Reports from 2015-2022.

Objectives:

The report illustrates Apple's journey to go carbon neutral from its 2015 baseline (38.4 million metric tons CO2e) by 2030. Apple aims to achieve 75% reduction by decreasing corporate and product life cycle emissions and rest 25% through carbon offsets.

The project describes categories and scopes of emission. The interactive graphs and charts depict major contributors of emission, changes in emission values over given time frame, the quantum of carbon footprints released for various products released, and targets achieved till now.

Data-driven insights derived from the visualizations and projections for 2030 can guide actions aimed at achieving desired goal.

Key Insights:

- Apples' Product Life Cycle gross emissions is whopping 98.53%, wherein major contributors are Manufacturing (purchased goods and services), Product use (use of sold products), and Product transportation 
  (upstream and downstream). However, Apple has reduced Manufacturing and Product use (use of sold products) by 54.7% and 25.8% respectively since 2015, and has seen increase in Product transportation by 46.2% 
  since 2015.
- Apple has achieved staggering market cap of $2.49 trillion in year 2022, with showing revenue growth of 68.7% since 2015 generating $394.33 billion in year 2022. At the same time, it managed to achieve 47% of 
  its carbon neutral target.
- Starting in 2021, the company has transitioned to a baseline storage of 128 while simultaneously reducing its carbon footprint. In reference to its latest phone release, Apple stated a carbon footprint of 56 
  kg CO2e.
- Apple initiated carbon offset efforts in 2020 and managed to achieve Product carbon offsets of -500000 only in 2021.
- Corporate emissions' Scope 3 includes employee commutes and business travels. Although these decreased in 2021 due to Covid, it's essential to keep monitoring these emissions.

Conclusion:

At current pace, Apple risks falling short of its overall target by 3.4 million metric tons of CO2e by missing to achieve carbon offset goal. Thought, it is well on its path to achieve 75% reduction by year 2028 only.

Apple should expand its sustainability efforts by investing in various green solutions and controlling other corporate and product emissions.
